            Congratulations to Moksh Mehta of Gr 12. Moksh wrote a 22-page research paper titled "The effect of glyphosate onimmune status and immune response to Escherichia colimodel pathogen".
            <br><br>
            This was done under the mentorship of a university professor from the United States. Moksh investigated the effect of glyphs are – the world's most prevalent pesticide – on the immune system and proposes a novel experiment using E.coli as a model pathogen that sheds more light on the issue. His paper is linked here.
