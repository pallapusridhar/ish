            Co-Curricular Activities
        </h1>
        <p>
            The Elementary and Secondary Schools offer a mix of Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) that are both age-appropriate, challenging, and engaging. These programs be they performing arts, crafts or sports are open to all students so as to help students develop skills and an appreciation of life-long learning, making friends, having fun, learning to play as a member of a team, learning to play fair, and improving self-esteem.
        </p>
        <p>
            CCAs for grades 1-5 and 6-12 are offered in both semesters. We believe that participation in these programs will result in better health and fitness, stronger physical skills, an enhanced understanding and appreciation of performing arts along with increased social interactions.
