        <p>
            ISH has annual productions in each section of the school. Each of these productions take place on our outdoor stage in a magical evening session that is highly attended and celebrated for the acting, choreography, music, props and costumes. Significantly, students are the leaders of all aspects of the secondary productions and elementary students are also provided with leadership opportunities for their production. One more example of students leading their own learning.
