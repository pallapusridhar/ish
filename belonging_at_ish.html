        <h3>
            Diversity, Inclusion, Equity and Justice at ISH  
        </h3>
        <p>
            An inclusive school community for over 40 years, we acknowledge the need to continue to learn and develop our practices to ensure we grow as a diverse, inclusive, equitable and just school community where everyone is valued and belongs.  
            
            <p>
            Diversity is the presence of a spectrum of identities that includes, but is not limited to: race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, gender, sexual identity, age, ability, and religion.  </p>
            
            <p>Equity, as opposed to equality, ensures that each person has access to the resources and opportunities needed to achieve their fullest potential.  </p>
            <br>
            <p>Inclusion ensures that the environment welcomes differences and each individual feels a sense of belonging.</p>
            
            <p>Justice recognizes that we must work to eliminate disparities so that all members of our community thrive.  </p>
            
            <p>We know that this work is ongoing and may sometimes prove difficult. Raising awareness to promote these concepts is required and we expect the engagement of all members of the ISH community in order to provide an environment that is safe, equitable, inclusive and just for all.  </p>
            
           <p> The ISH Community Expectations in support of Diversity, Equity, Justice and Belonging: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Respect all</li>
                <li>Speak our stories and listen to those of others</li>
                <li>Learn from the perspectives and experiences of others</li>
                <li>Seek to understand our biases and overcome them</li>
                <li>Foster an atmosphere of safety and belonging</li>
            </ul>
