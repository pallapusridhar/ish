            Athletics remain a cornerstone of student life at ISH as it complements the efforts made inside the classroom. As sports coaches our goals are:
        </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>to prepare students to enter the arena of life. We will stress hard work, leadership, camaraderie, sportsmanship, and fair play along with a desire to learn the intricacies of the activity. Together we will work to solve any problem.</li>
                    <li>to ensure that Athletics at ISH is held in high esteem by all stakeholders and that ISH students will enjoy many of these benefits for the rest of their lives. </li>
                </ul> 
                
          
           <p> 
            In order to meet these goals, ISH provides teams in the following Sports: Basketball, Football (soccer), Volleyball, Cricket, & Swimming. Whenever possible tournaments and trips are included in the program to provide extra incentives, opportunities and focus.
